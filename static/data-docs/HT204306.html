<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>If you enter the wrong passcode too many times, you&rsquo;ll see a message that your device is disabled. If you can&rsquo;t remember your passcode, you&#39;ll need to erase your device, which deletes all of your data and settings, including the passcode. Unless you made a backup before you forgot your passcode, there isn&#39;t a way to save the data on your device. Follow the steps below to remove your passcode. Or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7s8-zLG9ySQ">watch the Apple Support video</a> to learn what to do.</p>

<h2>Remove your passcode</h2>

<p>If you backed up your device, you can restore your data and settings after&nbsp;restoring your device. If you never backed up your device before you forgot your passcode, you won&#39;t be able to save the data on your device.&nbsp;</p>
