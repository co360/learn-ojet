<h2>If you have another device on iOS 11 or later, use Quick Start</h2>

<h2>Activate your device</h2>

<p>Tap the Wi-Fi network that you want to use or select a different option. If you&#39;re setting up an iPhone or iPad (Wi-Fi + Cellular), you might need to <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201337">insert your SIM card first</a>.</p>
